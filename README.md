# Project - 2 | Budgét

## What is the Project

This is our Project Budgét. This is a balance and budget app for people to set up categories and and budget limits. This allows the user to understand better their spending habits. As well as how they might want to save.

## Technologies

We used Node.js, Handlebars, Express.js, SQL and Ag-Grid to achieve this.
Node.js was for our server side handling, Handlebars is for a template of the pages, Express for the server set up. SQL to store the data. And Ag-grid to present the data to the client.

## How to install

Al the user needs to do is access the project page to get started.
